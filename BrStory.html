  <p>
    <b> upon a time in a quiet village, a curious girl named Eliza </b>
    <br /><i>ventured into the forbidden Enchanted Forest. Guided by a talking oak
      tree, she faced challenges,
    </i>
    <br />
    <u>
      friends with an owl and squirrel, and found a treasureâ€”a shimmering
      emerald book filled with boundless wisdom.
    </u>
    <br />
    Returning home, she shared her newfound knowledge, becoming a beloved
    figure who used her wisdom to better her village. <br />Her tale taught
    everyone that the greatest treasures often lay hidden in the heart of the
    unknown.
